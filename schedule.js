Open Data services exist in almost every web application: from social networking apps to governmental pages and the news, all this data can be instantly accessed by exposed APIs. However, although most of this data is offered in a simple interchange format, its structures are quite complex, ranging from complex networks to time-based information, hierarchical data or heavy graphs. Displaying this data in a manner that enables the viewer to gain some insight can be challenging, especially if we aim at providing some interaction and doing it in a cross-browser/cross-device manner. The JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit creates interactive data visualizations for the Web. It's based solely on Web Standards, leveraging the power of native browser technologies to provide insights on complex data. In this talk you will learn about the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit and how it can help you create advanced data visualizations for the Web.",

The inversion-of-inversion-of-inversion-of-control often needed is hard to read, write, and just plain understand. With pre-empetive multi-threading you delegate all control to the operating system and it handles concurrency for you. This comes at a great performance cost. However with JavaScript this simply isn't the model, there is one thread and finite snippets of code executed. There is nothing like being able to tell a computer exactly how much code to run and under what conditions and it just works under extreme load and/or concurrency.",

When well-meaning but uninformed deciders and developers see jQuery as the be-all-end-all answer, conflating a knowledge of jQuery with a knowledge of JavaScript, we all lose.

Further I will take a look under the cover and show how it is implemented so every attendee can start hacking on it right away. Another important feature of the IDE will be the integrated debugger.

However, today, as we are online most of our time, handling offline situations has become important for many web apps. And for mobile dev, storage is crucial: You wouldn't want to pull some hundred k of data via a slow connection again and again. This talk will take a tour around existing client side storage mechanisms. We'll start with cookies and see why it's a bad place to stay. Then we'll quickly move on to the good neighbours, visiting ancient places as well as futuristic ones and investigating their ins and outs. And we'll also stop by the frameworks/wrappers that give easy access to them. To make things more interesting, we'll then board a submarine and dive into the crazy world of mobile devices, it's special demands and see what options exist over there.
